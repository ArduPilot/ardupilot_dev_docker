## Container Hierarchy

### Docker Images

The docker images provide base environment to compile ArduPilot. They don't contain ArduPilot code but only the packages needed to compile the binaries. Each image is based on Ubuntu 20.04

The main image is [ardupilot-dev-base ](Dockerfile_dev-base). Other images will inherit from it.
Each image is specialized to contain only the necessary tools to build the related binaries.

## Building

```
cd docker
docker build -t khancyr/ardupilot-dev-base -f Dockerfile_dev-base .
```

## Release

Docker images are build with Github Actions. On each PR, they are fresh build from latest source.
In order to publish them to DockerHub, we need to make a release and tag the image.

## Setting

The repo setting is quite simple, it need Github Action and an account on DockerHub.
In order to be able to publish the image on DockerHub, you need to set two secrets on your repo setting :
`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
